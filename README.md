# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Churn Prediction System

Machine Learning-powered Customer Analytics Application for predicting customer churn using demographic and behavioral data. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Streamlit to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve customer retention strategies.

**Python • Scikit-learn • XGBoost • Streamlit • Pandas • NumPy**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by businesses. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on historical customer data and behavioral patterns.

The application provides:

* Real-time churn prediction
* Probability-based churn assessment
* Interactive Streamlit dashboard
* Customer behavior analysis
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
* Business decision support for retention strategies
